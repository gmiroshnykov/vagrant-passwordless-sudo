Vagrant Passwordless Sudo
=========================

This script automatically modifies `/etc/sudoers` to allow commands like
`vagrant up` to proceed without asking for your sudo password.

Supported features:

  * NFS synced folders
  * [vagrant-hostsupdater](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater)

Tested with Vagrant 1.4.

Current version supports OS X only.

This script was inspired by and is based on Nick Muerdter's
[install_vagrant_sudoers.sh](https://gist.github.com/GUI/2864683).


Usage
-----

    $ sudo ./vagrant-passwordless-sudo.sh
    Password:
    All done, vagrant should not ask for your sudo password anymore!

The following lines will be appended to your `/etc/sudoers`:

    ##### BEGIN VAGRANT PASSWORDLESS SUDO #####
    ###
    ### Generated by vagrant-passworless-sudo, modify at your own risk!
    ###

    # NFS commands
    Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD = /bin/bash -c echo '*' >> /etc/exports
    Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_NFSD_RESTART = /sbin/nfsd restart
    Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE = /usr/bin/sed -E -e /*/ d -ibak /etc/exports
    %staff ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD, VAGRANT_NFSD_RESTART, VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE

    # vagrant-hostsupdater commands
    Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_HOST_ADD = /bin/sh -c echo "*" >> /etc/hosts
    Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_HOST_REMOVE = /usr/bin/sed -i -e /*/ d /etc/hosts
    %staff ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_HOST_ADD, VAGRANT_HOST_REMOVE
    ##### END VAGRANT PASSWORDLESS SUDO #####


The script cleans after itself, so it's completely safe to re-run it at any time.
